<h2>What is Cricket?</h2>
<p>Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. <br> The field is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres) wide. <br> Two sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch.</p>
